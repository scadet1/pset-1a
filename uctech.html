    <h1>TIPS FOR UCTECH FRESHMAN</h1>
    <h2 class="section-header">What is UCTECH?</h2>
    <p>UCTECH is one of the schools that focus on many different skills such as Cosmetology, Teaching, Crafting, Automobiles, Law and Justice, and so much more. Being able to have this kind of choice and being around people with so many different career types is what UCTECH is all about. Use this to your advantage, and don't just focus on friends in your academy!</p>

    <h2>Here's Some Tips</h2>
    <p>Me not being a student at UCTECH makes the information I can give very limited. However, I do have friends that attend UCTECH that have given me some informtation, and I do have information I've noticed from the outside.</p>
<ol>
    <li>MAKE AND ACADEMY GROUP CHAT - If you are confused with a homework, project, or any work, that groupchat consists of at least one person that has done it already, and can give you help and tips on how to complete it. "Communication is Key" said by UCTECH Teaching student Taina Annylusse
    <li>GET ALONG WITH YOUR ACADEMY - You will be with your academy for the next four years. Get along with them! If you don't, tensions will rise, and that will cause for your academy not to succeed. Doing ice - breakers with them definetly helps that process.
    <li>TALK TO THE UPPERCLASSMEN IN YOUR ACADEMY - If you mess up in anything, chances are upperclassmen have made the same mistakes too. They can tell you how to fix it, and give you tips and reccomendations on how not to make the same mistake in the future.
</ol>
    <p>I hope you find this information useful in progressing during your freshman year.</p>
