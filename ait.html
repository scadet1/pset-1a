    <h1>Tips for AIT Freshman</h1>
    <h2 class="section-header">What is AIT?</h2>
    <p>AIT is one of the schools at UCVTS that represents our Business and skills. The school offeres college courses on Technology, and Business for the first two years at AIT. This is so the students can get a feel for the each of the topics so their decision can be more accurate. Later in Junior Year, the student gets to pick their pathway, and choose between IT, or Business. This helps them further in their career to make them be used to tough choices and the outcomes of your choices.

    <h2>Here's Some Tips</h2>
    <p>Great News! Unlike the other four schools, I go to AIT! Which means all of the tips I give I have experienced hands-on, so these will absolutley help you in the future.
<ol>
    <li>AIT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER SCHOOLS - AIT is very unique. Every activity, assignment, name or anything is else is most likley going to be different from the way the other schools do it. So don't try to steal some information from your friends at UCTECH, because it wont be the same. Believe me, I tried and learned the hard way.
    <li>AIT'S IS A BIG CIRCLE ON TWO DIFFERENT FLOORS - AIT is a circle. Keep walkign around and around, you will realize this too. All of the room numbers are in order, and most likley on the side of the doors. Don't be shy to ask for directions from standing teachers and upperclassmen.
    <li>SOME OF THE CLASSES ARE SEPERATED USING A THIN WALL - Most classes that are side by side are only seperated by a thin wall. Be very quiet in the classroom, because noise travels through that wall, and the classroom next door will be able to hear everything rather than through a regular wall.
</ol>
    <p>I hope you find all of this information useful as you progress on and on through high school.</p>
