    <h2>Here's Some Tips</h2>
    <p>Me not being a student at MHS makes the information I can give very limited. However, I do have friends that attend MHS that have given me some informtation, and I do have information I've noticed from the outside.</p>
<ol>
    <li>MHS ARE FULL OF VERY INTELLIGENT KIDS - Magent is known for having the very gifted kids attend there, just because "its Magnet". Being the smartest out of all of the Magnet students is difficult, however, knowing this is the case and applying yourself can help this become a reality.
    <li>PAY ATTENTION WHEN YOU ARE IN THE HALLWAY TO THE ROOM NUMBER - The room numbers in Magnet are not in order, so upperclassmen should be your best friend. These upperclassman should be able to direct you around the school easily, because thery have gotten used to it over the years.
    <li>BE QUIET IN THE HALLWAYS - Because the classes are together and cponnected, being quiet in the hallway is crucial, and also in the rooms too, because you could be disturbing other classes from learning.
</ol>
    <p>I hope you find this information useful in progressing during your freshman year.</p>
