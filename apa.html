    <h2>Here's Some Tips</h2>
    <p>Me not being a student at APA makes the information I can give very limited. However, I do have friends that attend APA that have given me some informtation, and I do have information I've noticed from the outside.</p>
<ol>
    <li>APA IS BY FAR THE EASTIEST SCHOOL - According to students from the other four schools, when it comes to the workload of classes, assignments, and punishments, APA is much less of a struggle. Howver, even though it is fairly easy, do not take advantage of it. You can really mess up your grade if you treat it as such, and set your goal lower. Always set your goal high no matter how easy the minimum is.</li>
    <li>CONTROL YOUR TOP PRIORITIES - Controlling your priorities at APA is very difficult. Its hard when you have lines to memorize or dances to learn, and take part in your main classes such as Math, English, Spanish, Science, etc. They are all just as important as your vocational classes. You must know when its time to participate in your vocationals, and when its time to learn.
    <li>TAKE YOUR VOCATIONAL CLASSES SERIOUSLY - When it comes to taking your dance or theatre classes seriously, its a major problem throughout the frshman class. People seem to take it as an easy subject, when its not. It is just like every other class. You must try hard and do everyhting your teacher would tell you to do. Just because the style your getting taught in is more hands-on, doesn't mean its not a class.
</ol>
    <p>I hope you find this information useful in progressing during your freshman year.</p>
